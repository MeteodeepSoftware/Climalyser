To operate you simply enter a number in, between 1 and 5 on how much a certain activity or parameter in YOUR local area/enviroment is affecting climate change locally (e.g Coastline Pollution/Industury Pollution) YOU then 'grade' this variable from 1 to 5 as mentioned earlier with 1 having least effect on the climate and 5 having most effect, this is all up to YOUR take on the climate around YOU")
